Overwatch Trivia
=======================================
A timed trivia game I made for my full-stack coding bootcamp. Upon starting the game, questions with multiple choice answers will appear on the screen, and the user must answer them before time runs out. The user will be able to see their final score at the end. The theme and questions are based on the game Overwatch!

## Technologies Used
+ Page elements and styling were done with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, and the game logic with Javascript. 
  
+ I used the **jQuery** library to dynamically update elements on my page and added timed functionality for my trivia questions within my game logic. 
  
+ Build using the **Bootstrap** CDN for general page layout and added responsiveness, as well as the **animate.css** CDN for some of the animations.

## Gameplay

1. Hit the button labeled "begin" and the first question will appear on the screen.
2. You have 10 seconds to answer the question!
3. The game will tell you if you got it right, or tell you the right answer if you got it wrong.
4. You can see your total score at the end, and try again if you want :2nd_place_medal:.
