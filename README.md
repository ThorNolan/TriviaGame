Trivia!
=======================================
A timed trivia game I made for unit 5 of my full-stack coding bootcamp. Page elements and styling were done with HTML and CSS, and the game logic with Javascript. I used the jQuery library to dynamically update elements on my page and add timed functionality for my trivia questions.
